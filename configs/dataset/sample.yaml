# Dataset configuration for SAMPLE (Synthetic and Measured Paired Labeled Experiment)
# Split protocol per sample_public.pdf:
#   Test:  measured (real) images at test_elevation (17 deg)
#   Train: remaining images, with k controlling measured/synthetic ratio
name: sample

# Root directory containing png_images/{normalization}/{real,synth}/{class}/
root_dir: ./data/sample/png_images

# Image normalization type: "qpm" (quarter power magnitude) or "decibel"
normalization: qpm

# Measured/synthetic mixing ratio for training set
# k=1.0: all measured, k=0.0: all synthetic, k=0.5: half and half
k: 1.0

# Elevation angle (as 3-digit string) to withhold for testing
test_elevation: "017"

# Number of target classes
num_classes: 10

# Image preprocessing
image_size: 128
num_channels: 1

# Normalization statistics (computed from SAMPLE QPM real training partition)
# QPM: mean=[0.2532], std=[0.1131]  |  Decibel: mean=[0.6039], std=[0.1182]
# Update these if switching normalization to decibel
mean: [0.2532]
std: [0.1131]

# Data augmentation (applied only to training set)
augmentation:
    random_rotation: 15
    horizontal_flip: true
    vertical_flip: true
    gaussian_noise_std: 0.02

# DataLoader settings
batch_size: 64
num_workers: 4
pin_memory: true
